# About Mux
In the beginning, there was nothing. Then on one ordinary day, genesis occurred for MuxWorks.
A brave soul by the name of Mux Wan (Maksudul Dewan) founded the pillars of creation that would hold Mux together.
Nearly 7 years later, his mission continues to inspire others who have similar ambitions like him - to unify and exorcise this planet from all evil.

Today, Mux, a limited liability company, owns and runs a whole fleet of startups fuelled by creative souls who yearn to express their passions.

> A conglomerate aiming to drown the world with its accomplishments. We are Mux, a group of enthusiasts and hobbyists accumulating our prowess for a major showdown in the future.
We also dream to craft the ideal organization where anyone can get hired as long as they have the determination for it! No more resumes or interviews. Join, train, and set to work!
We are Mux LLC.
