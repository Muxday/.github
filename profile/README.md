# About Muxday
In the beginning, there was nothing. Then on one ordinary day, genesis occurred for Muxday.
A brave soul by the name of Mux Wan (Maksudul Dewan) founded the pillars of creation that would hold Muxday together.
Nearly 16 years later, his mission continues to inspire others who have similar ambitions like him - to unify and exorcise this planet from all evil.

Today, Muxday, owns and runs a whole fleet of startups fuelled by creative souls who yearn to express their passions.
