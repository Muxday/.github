# About Mux
In the beginning, there was nothing. Then on one ordinary day, genesis occurred for MuxWorks.
A brave soul by the name of Mux Wan (Maksudul Dewan) founded the pillars of creation that would hold Mux together.
Nearly 7 years later, his mission continues to inspire others who have similar ambitions like him - to unify and exorcise this planet from all evil.

Today, Mux, a limited liability company, owns and runs a whole fleet of startups fuelled by creative souls who yearn to express their passions.
